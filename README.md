#[Natura]

This is a fork of Natura for Minecraft 1.7.10. It's focus is on improving and de-bloating Natura.
Changes from the original:
* Overworld woods are now burnable.
* Fence gates, Buttons, Pressure plates, Slabs, Stairs, etc are now craftable
* Added config options to disable and set the rarity of the mobs
* Added config options to disable blocks and items
* Disabled by default the generation of redwood trees and grass dropping barley and cotton seeds (wild ones still spawn and you can get their seeds from them).
* Only one kind of flour
* Removed multiple unused textures
* Removed unused code
* Removed dependancy on mantle
* Removed stuff considered bloated and annoying (eg the sticks, tools, etc)
* Merged all the creative tabs into one
* Other bug fixes
