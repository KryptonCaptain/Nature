#[Natura]

This is a fork of Natura for Minecraft 1.7.10. It's focus is on improving and de-bloating Natura.
Changes from the original:
* Overworld woods are now burnable.
* Added config options to disable and set the rarity of the mobs
* Removed multiple unused textures
* Removed unused code
* Removed stuff considered bloated (eg the sticks, tools, buttons, pressure plates, etc)
* Merged all the creative tabs into one
